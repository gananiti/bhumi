# References

The shashtra folder format is defined in terms of these main other resources.

## Mantra: @`shashtra-refs-file`

Every shashtra folder contains a reference file, "shashtra-refs-file" `refs.md`, 
which tells you what other shashtra this shashtra is related to. 

You are seeing one such file. Rest of the details in 
`bhumi://bhumi-shashtra/shashtra-refs-file`.

## Mantra: @`shashtra-alias`

For each referred shashtra we also have an alias, so for this shashtra, the 
current shashtra is given the alias "bhumi-shashtra", which is available in
https://github.com/gananiti/bhumi/archive/refs/heads/main.zip, but we do not
have to keep referring to this full url, we can use the alias to construct the
bhumi url.

## Mantra: @`shashtra-download-url`

If a shashtra is distributed by bhumi://bhumi-shashtra/plain-net shashtra will 
have a URL from where the `.zip` or any other supported archive format like 
`.tar.gz` etc can be downloaded. The @`shashtra-download-url`.


## Mantra: @`shashtra-bhumi-path`
