# Bhūmi  

*the field where thoughts take root*

### What is Bhūmi?

Bhūmi is the living ground of **Gananīti** — the way of groups.  
It is not an app or a platform, but a **shared field of presence** where people, ideas, and software can coexist without control.

A Bhūmi is simply a static website that lives somewhere — on a domain, in a folder, on a USB stick.  
Anyone can host one. The person who keeps it alive is called the **Lokpal**, the caretaker of that realm.

Each visitor to a Bhūmi becomes a **Gaṇa** — a small conscious node.  
Your browser quietly holds your own space of reflection, dialogue, and trust.  
Nothing leaves your device unless *you* decide to share it.

### Why it exists

Bhūmi is an attempt to return technology to human scale.

Most software today replaces trust with verification, and conversation with automation.  
Bhūmi moves the other way: it assumes trust, honours disagreement, and lets understanding grow through **Matgaḍāna** — reflection and dialogue.

It is a gentle invitation to rebuild the digital world from first principles:
- no servers controlling the flow,
- no analytics following you,
- no central authority deciding truth,
- only people, sharing and contemplating their **Mats** — their thoughts.

### The heartbeat of a Bhūmi

| Sanskrit term | Meaning | What happens |
|---------------|----------|---------------|
| **Matdān** | offering of a mat | you share what you think or observe |
| **Matgaḍāna** | reflection | you see others’ mats, find differences (*mat-bheda*), and think again |
| **Śuddhikāraṇa** | cleansing | from time to time, the Bhūmi suggests ways to condense and clarify what has been said |

These three motions — giving, reflecting, cleansing — form the living rhythm of every Bhūmi.

### How it stays alive

A Bhūmi can be hosted anywhere.  
The **Lokpal** only keeps the soil alive: renews the domain, serves the latest open-source code, and ensures there is no tracking or data collection.

All real life — your data, your relations, your decisions — stays on your own device, inside your browser’s local store.  
You may connect to others directly (peer-to-peer) or even through printed or spoken Mats.

If the Lokpal disappears, anyone can mirror the same code and continue.  
Nothing is owned, only cared for.

### Relation to other parts of Gananīti

- [`gananiti/shashtra`](https://github.com/gananiti/shashtra) holds the **mantras** and **yantras** — the canonical knowledge and tools.  
- [`gananiti/katha`](https://github.com/gananiti/katha) tells the **stories** and interpretations that make it human.  
- **Bhūmi** is where these ideas are *lived*.

### Vision

> A single vast Lok, where thought can move freely,  
> where trust is personal,  
> where disagreement is sacred,  
> and where every human — every Gaṇa —  
> can think in the open without being watched.

Bhūmi is a small piece of code meant to hold that possibility.

### How to begin

Visit any Bhūmi, for example [amitu.com/bhumi](https://amitu.com/bhumi).  
Your browser becomes a Gaṇa.  
You can start writing and reflecting immediately.  
Nothing to sign up for, nothing to download.

When you wish, you can host your own Bhūmi, or create your own **Bahirmat** — your public expression of thoughts — and share it with others.

---

### License & ethos

Bhūmi is open-source, free to use, and free to fork.  
Please keep it gentle: no analytics, no dark patterns, no centralization.  
Treat every visitor as a conscious being, not as data.
